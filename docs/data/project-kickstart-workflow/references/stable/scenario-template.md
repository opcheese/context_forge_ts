Create at least one scenario per persona. Cover the primary happy path and at least one edge case or failure scenario per persona.

---

## Scenario: [Descriptive name]

**Persona:** [Name from L2]
**Trigger:** [What causes this journey to start? Be specific — not "opens app" but "receives notification that weekly report is ready"]

### Journey Steps

| Step | Action | Touchpoint | Thinking | Feeling | Pain (1-5) |
|------|--------|------------|----------|---------|------------|
| 1 | [What the user does] | [Where/how — app, email, phone, in-person] | [What they're trying to figure out] | [Emotional state] | [1=fine, 5=frustrated] |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |

### Opportunities
[Where can our product intervene? Which steps have the highest pain scores? Which steps could be eliminated entirely?]

### Success Criteria
[How does the user know this scenario went well? What's the measurable outcome?]

### Edge Cases
- [What if step X fails? What does the user do?]
- [What if the user abandons mid-journey? What's lost?]

---

[Repeat for each scenario.]

## Scenario Map
[Which scenarios overlap? Where do personas cross paths? Are there shared touchpoints that need to handle multiple personas?]
