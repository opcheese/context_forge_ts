# Terms of Use

*Last updated: February 2026*

## What This Is

ContextForge is a free, open-source tool for managing context in LLM interactions. The hosted version at convexforgets.com is provided as-is, with no guarantees of uptime, support, or continued availability.

## Your Account

- You're responsible for keeping your credentials secure
- One person per account — no sharing accounts
- We can suspend or delete accounts that abuse the service

## Your Content

You own everything you create in ContextForge. We don't claim any rights to your context blocks, templates, sessions, or other content.

When you publish content to the Community Marketplace, you grant other users the right to use it. You can unpublish at any time, but copies already downloaded by others remain theirs.

## Marketplace Content

Content in the Community Marketplace is provided by users, not by us. We don't review, endorse, or guarantee any marketplace content. Use it at your own risk.

## LLM-Generated Content

ContextForge helps you interact with LLM providers (OpenRouter, Ollama) using your own API keys. We are not responsible for the output of these models. LLM-generated content may be inaccurate, biased, or inappropriate. You are responsible for reviewing and verifying any content generated through the app.

## No Warranty

This software is provided "as-is" without warranty of any kind. There is no SLA, no guaranteed uptime, and no obligation to provide support. This is an open-source project, not a commercial service.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the maintainers of ContextForge are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the service, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of revenue, or reliance on LLM-generated content.

## Changes

We may update these terms. Changes are tracked in the git history of this file. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance.
