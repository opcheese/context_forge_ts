# Screen Mocks (Optional)

Fat-marker sketches only. Focus on information architecture, not visual design. If you can add detail, you're too detailed.

## Screen: [Name]

**Scenario step:** [Which step from L3 does this screen serve?]
**Persona:** [Primary user of this screen]

### Purpose
[One sentence: what the user accomplishes on this screen]

### Key Elements
- [Element 1: what it is, why it's here]
- [Element 2]
- [Element 3]
[If listing more than 7 elements, the screen is too complex. Split it.]

### User Actions
- [What can the user do here? List interactive elements only]

### Data Displayed
- [What information does the user see? Where does it come from?]

### Navigation
- [Where does the user come from? Where can they go next?]

### Notes
- [Accessibility considerations]
- [Responsive behavior if relevant]
- [Open design questions]

[Repeat for key screens only. 3-5 screens for a typical project. If you need more than 10, your scope is too large for one appetite.]

For detailed visual design, use the `frontend-design` Claude Code skill.
