# Project Brief

## Product / Feature
[Name and one-sentence description]

## Appetite
[Time budget: how much are we willing to invest? e.g., "6 weeks", "2 sprints". This is NOT an estimate — it's a decision about how much this problem is worth.]

## Problem Statement
[Who has this problem? What evidence do we have? What happens if we don't solve it?]

## CIRCLES Walkthrough

### Comprehend
[What is the situation? What triggered this project? What do we already know?]

### Identify Customer
[Primary user segment: who specifically? Secondary segments? Who is explicitly NOT a target?]

### Report Needs
[Top 3 user needs, stated as problems, not solutions. What workarounds do they currently use?]

### Cut (Prioritize)
[Which needs are must-have for this appetite? What would a "walking skeleton" address?]

### List Solutions
[2-3 possible approaches. Keep it high-level — mechanisms, not features.]

### Evaluate Tradeoffs
[For each approach: effort, risk, user impact, technical feasibility. Which fits the appetite?]

### Summarize
[One paragraph: recommended approach, what we're building, what we're NOT building, and why.]

## Raw Materials
[Paste or link: meeting transcripts, client emails, research notes, competitor screenshots]

## Open Questions
[What do we still need to find out? Who do we need to talk to?]

## How to Use This Template

1. **Fill top-down.** Start with Product/Feature and Appetite before diving into CIRCLES.
2. **Appetite is a decision, not an estimate.** Decide how much this problem is worth before scoping solutions.
3. **Keep placeholders honest.** If you cannot fill a section, write "UNKNOWN — need [specific action]" instead of guessing.
4. **Raw Materials matter.** Paste actual quotes, data, screenshots. The brief is only as strong as its evidence.
5. **Open Questions drive next steps.** Every unanswered question should have an owner and a deadline.

## Quality Checklist

Before moving to IRD (L1), verify:

- [ ] Appetite is explicitly stated as a time budget
- [ ] Problem Statement references real evidence (not assumptions)
- [ ] Identify Customer names a specific segment, not "all users"
- [ ] Report Needs lists problems, not solutions
- [ ] Cut section explicitly excludes at least one need from scope
- [ ] List Solutions has at least 2 alternatives (not just the obvious one)
- [ ] Evaluate Tradeoffs references the appetite constraint
- [ ] Summarize fits in one paragraph and states what we are NOT building
- [ ] Open Questions each have a path to resolution

## Common Pitfalls

- **Solution-first thinking.** If your Brief starts with "we need to build X", back up. What problem does X solve?
- **Vague customer.** "Small businesses" is not a segment. "Solo freelance designers billing < 5 clients/month" is.
- **Missing appetite.** Without a time budget, scope will expand to fill all available time.
- **Empty Raw Materials.** A brief without evidence is a wish list. Attach the data.
- **Skipping Cut.** If everything is must-have, nothing is. Force a priority call.

## Next Step

When this Brief is complete, proceed to the **GATE decision** to determine GO / PIVOT / KILL before investing in the IRD (L1).
