Let's take a real prompt — the kind most people paste into ChatGPT — and transform it step by step into structured context.

## The messy prompt

Here's what most people type:

> You are an expert TypeScript developer. I'm building a SaaS product. The tech stack is React, Convex, TanStack Router, Tailwind. My coding style prefers small pure functions, no classes, conventional commits. Current task: add drag-and-drop reordering to the block list. Reference the existing DnD setup.

This works. Barely. The LLM gets some useful information, but everything is mixed together — permanent preferences, project details, and the current task are all in one paragraph.

## Step 1: Identify what never changes

Read through your prompt and highlight anything that's true regardless of project or task:

- "Expert TypeScript developer" → **Permanent** (role)
- "Small pure functions, no classes" → **Permanent** (style)
- "Conventional commits" → **Permanent** (convention)

```
PERMANENT:
Role: Senior TypeScript engineer
Style: Pure functions · No classes · Minimal abstractions
Commits: Conventional (feat:, fix:, docs:)
```

## Step 2: Separate project context

What's specific to this project but stable across sessions?

- "React, Convex, TanStack Router, Tailwind" → **Stable** (stack)
- "Existing DnD setup" → **Stable** (reference)

```
STABLE:
Stack: React 19 · Convex · TanStack Router · Tailwind v4
DnD: @dnd-kit/core already installed
Reference: src/components/dnd/ (existing implementation)
```

## Step 3: Isolate the current task

What changes every session?

- "Add drag-and-drop reordering to the block list" → **Working**

```
WORKING:
Task: Add drag-and-drop block reordering
Target: src/components/BlockList.tsx
Must work on: Desktop + mobile touch
Done when: Blocks reorder on drop, order persists
```

## The result

**Before:** 3 sentences, everything mixed, no reusability.

**After:** 3 zones, each reusable at its own pace. The permanent zone follows you everywhere. The stable zone follows you through this project. The working zone is fresh each session.

Next session, you only rewrite the working block. Everything else stays.

## Try it now

Take your last LLM prompt and run it through these three steps. You'll be surprised how much of it is permanent or stable context you've been retyping every time.

Or let [ContextForge](https://convexforgets.com) do the organizing for you — drag blocks between zones, track token counts, and export structured context in one click.
