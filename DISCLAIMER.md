# AI Content Disclaimer

ContextForge helps you build and manage context for interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). When you use the brainstorming or generation features, the output comes from third-party LLM providers (OpenRouter, Ollama) — not from us.

## What This Means

- **LLM output may be inaccurate, misleading, or inappropriate.** Models can hallucinate facts, generate biased content, or produce plausible-sounding nonsense.
- **You are responsible for reviewing and verifying** any content generated through ContextForge before relying on it.
- **We don't control the models.** Your prompts go directly to the LLM provider using your own API key. We have no ability to filter, moderate, or guarantee the quality of responses.
- **Don't use LLM output as a substitute for professional advice** in areas like law, medicine, finance, or safety-critical applications.

## Your API Keys, Your Responsibility

ContextForge operates on a bring-your-own-key (BYOK) model. You provide your own API keys for LLM providers. Usage costs, rate limits, and provider terms are between you and the provider.
