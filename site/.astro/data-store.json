Here's how context zones keep your world consistent.",["Date","2026-02-20T00:00:00.000Z"],[19,33,34],"game-design","tutorial","Game designers face a unique challenge with AI: **consistency across a massive creative space.** Your world has history, factions, rules of magic, character voices. Every AI-generated piece of content needs to respect all of it.\n\nWithout structured context, you get generic fantasy. With it, you get content that feels like it belongs in *your* world.\n\n## The game designer permanent zone\n\n```\nRole: Narrative designer for a dark fantasy RPG\nTone: Gritty, understated. No flowery prose. Characters speak in short sentences.\nWorld rules: Magic costs something physical (blood, memories, years of life)\nTaboos: No chosen-one narratives. No prophecies. History is messy and contested.\nFormat: Dialogue in screenplay format. Lore entries under 200 words.\n```\n\nThis is your creative bible. Set it once and every AI session respects your world's rules.\n\n## Project-level stable context\n\n```\nCurrent region: The Ashmark — a volcanic wasteland with three rival settlements\nFactions:\n- The Smelters (industrial, pragmatic, exploit volcanic heat for forging)\n- The Ashwalkers (nomadic, spiritual, believe the volcano is a sleeping god)\n- The Ledger (merchant guild, controls trade routes, politically neutral)\nKey NPCs: Voss (Smelter foreman, missing left hand), Enna (Ashwalker elder, blind)\nRecent events: Eruption destroyed the northern trade route 3 months ago\n```\n\n## Working context per session\n\n**Generating quest content:**\n```\nTask: Write 3 side quests for the Smelter settlement\nRequirements: Each quest should reveal faction tensions. One must involve Voss.\nConstraints: Player level 5-8. No fetch quests. Each takes 15-20 minutes.\n```\n\n**Writing NPC dialogue:**\n```\nTask: Write Enna's dialogue when the player first enters the Ashwalker camp\nContext: Player has already sided with the Smelters on a previous quest\nEnna knows this: she's disappointed but not hostile\nLength: 8-12 lines of dialogue with 2 player response options\n```\n\n## The consistency payoff\n\nWithout zones, every AI session starts from scratch. You'd need to re-explain the entire world. Worse, the AI might contradict earlier content — giving magic a different cost system, changing a character's voice, or generating a chosen-one storyline you explicitly banned.\n\nWith permanent and stable zones, the AI can't drift. Your world rules are always active. Your faction dynamics are always loaded. You only change the working zone to focus on today's content needs.\n\n*Coming soon: a full walkthrough using ContextForge for game narrative pipelines.*","src/content/blog/ai-worldbuilding-game-designers.mdx","52d14551aedb9bd0","context-engineering-for-pms",{"id":38,"data":40,"body":46,"filePath":47,"digest":48,"deferredRender":22},{"title":41,"description":42,"publishedAt":43,"author":17,"tags":44,"draft":22},"Context Engineering for Product Managers","Product managers can get dramatically better AI output by structuring their context.

What drives retention?\nOutput: Top 5 themes with supporting quotes, recommended actions\n```\n\n**Stakeholder update:**\n```\nTask: Write weekly stakeholder update\nAudience: CEO + CTO\nTone: Direct, highlight blockers and decisions needed\nCover: Linked blocks progress, beta user growth, next week priorities\n```\n\n## Why this works for PMs\n\nWithout context structure, you get generic MBA-speak from AI.

Current task: add drag-and-drop reordering to the block list. Reference the existing DnD setup.\n\nThis works. Barely. The LLM gets some useful information, but everything is mixed together — permanent preferences, project details, and the current task are all in one paragraph.\n\n## Step 1: Identify what never changes\n\nRead through your prompt and highlight anything that's true regardless of project or task:\n\n- \"Expert TypeScript developer\" → **Permanent** (role)\n- \"Small pure functions, no classes\" → **Permanent** (style)\n- \"Conventional commits\" → **Permanent** (convention)\n\n```\nPERMANENT:\nRole: Senior TypeScript engineer\nStyle: Pure functions · No classes · Minimal abstractions\nCommits: Conventional (feat:, fix:, docs:)\n```\n\n## Step 2: Separate project context\n\nWhat's specific to this project but stable across sessions?\n\n- \"React, Convex, TanStack Router, Tailwind\" → **Stable** (stack)\n- \"Existing DnD setup\" → **Stable** (reference)\n\n```\nSTABLE:\nStack: React 19 · Convex · TanStack Router · Tailwind v4\nDnD: @dnd-kit/core already installed\nReference: src/components/dnd/ (existing implementation)\n```\n\n## Step 3: Isolate the current task\n\nWhat changes every session?\n\n- \"Add drag-and-drop reordering to the block list\" → **Working**\n\n```\nWORKING:\nTask: Add drag-and-drop block reordering\nTarget: src/components/BlockList.tsx\nMust work on: Desktop + mobile touch\nDone when: Blocks reorder on drop, order persists\n```\n\n## The result\n\n**Before:** 3 sentences, everything mixed, no reusability.\n\n**After:** 3 zones, each reusable at its own pace.

Everything else stays.\n\n## Try it now\n\nTake your last LLM prompt and run it through these three steps.

You're just doing it badly.\n\n**Context engineering** is the practice of deliberately structuring the information you provide to a language model so it can do its best work. Instead of dumping everything into a single prompt, you organize context into layers with different lifespans and purposes.\n\n## Why does it matter?\n\nLLMs don't remember. Every conversation starts from zero. The only thing that shapes their behavior is what you put in the context window — and that window has limits.\n\nMost people waste those limits:\n- Repeating the same system instructions every session\n- Mixing permanent rules with temporary tasks\n- Losing track of which context blocks are still relevant\n- Copy-pasting from documents without trimming irrelevant sections\n\nThe result? Inconsistent answers, wasted tokens, and the frustrating feeling that the AI \"forgot\" what you told it.\n\n## The three-zone model\n\nContextForge uses a simple mental model: **Permanent**, **Stable**, and **Working** zones.\n\n- **Permanent** — Things that never change: your role definition, coding style, communication preferences. Set once, reuse forever.\n- **Stable** — Project-level context: tech stack, architecture decisions, reference docs. Changes when you switch projects.\n- **Working** — The current task: what you're building right now, relevant code snippets, immediate constraints. Changes every session.\n\nThis isn't just organization for organization's sake. When you separate context by lifespan, you can:\n1. Reuse permanent and stable blocks across sessions without re-typing\n2. Swap working context without losing your foundation\n3. Stay within token budgets by compressing or dropping the right layers\n\n## Getting started\n\nYou don't need a tool to start context engineering (though [ContextForge](https://convexforgets.com) makes it much easier). Start by answering three questions before your next LLM session:\n\n1. **What never changes?** Write it down once. That's your permanent zone.\n2. **What's true for this project?** Tech stack, style guides, domain knowledge. That's stable.\n3. **What am I doing right now?** The specific task and its constraints. That's working.\n\nEven this simple separation will noticeably improve your results.","src/content/blog/what-is-context-engineering.mdx","ca84c62391c20456"]
