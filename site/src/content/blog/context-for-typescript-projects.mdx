I build SaaS products with TypeScript, React, and Convex. Every day I'm in Claude or ChatGPT asking for help with components, database schemas, API design. Here's how I structure my context to get consistently good results.

## My permanent zone

This never changes, regardless of which project I'm working on:

```
Role: Senior TypeScript engineer
Style: Pure functions, no classes, minimal abstractions
Commits: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:)
Testing: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
Opinions: YAGNI ruthlessly. Prefer composition over inheritance.
```

That's it — 5 lines. I set this once and it applies to every session.

## Project-level stable context

When I switch between projects, I swap this block:

```
Stack: React 19 + TanStack Router + Convex + Tailwind v4
UI: shadcn/ui components, Bricolage Grotesque font
State: Convex reactive queries (no Redux, no Zustand)
Auth: Convex Auth with GitHub OAuth
Deploy: Vercel (frontend) + Convex (backend)
File conventions: kebab-case files, PascalCase components
```

I also keep a "reference" block with key file paths:

```
Key files:
- src/routes/__root.tsx — root layout, auth guard
- convex/schema.ts — database schema (source of truth)
- src/components/ui/ — shadcn primitives
- convex/functions/ — all backend mutations/queries
```

## Working context (changes every task)

This is the only part I rewrite each session:

```
Task: Add drag-and-drop reordering to the block list
Constraints: Use @dnd-kit/core (already installed). Must work on mobile.
Relevant code: src/components/BlockList.tsx (current implementation)
Acceptance: Blocks reorder on drop. Order persists to Convex. Undo supported.
```

## The difference this makes

Without structured context, I'd paste my entire component file and say "add drag and drop." The LLM would guess my style, maybe use the wrong library, and produce code that doesn't match my patterns.

With zones, the LLM knows:
- To write pure functions (permanent)
- That I'm using Convex, not REST APIs (stable)
- Exactly what "done" looks like (working)

The result: first-attempt code that actually fits my codebase.

## Try it yourself

1. Open [ContextForge](https://convexforgets.com)
2. Create your permanent zone (5-10 lines about your style)
3. Add a stable block for your current project's stack
4. Write a working block for today's task
5. Export and paste into your LLM of choice

You'll notice the difference immediately.
