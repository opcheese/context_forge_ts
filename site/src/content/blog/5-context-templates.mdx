You don't need to build your context from scratch. Here are five templates you can copy, customize, and start using immediately.

Testing: [Framework and approach]
Commits: [Convention]

STABLE:
Stack: [Framework + database + deployment]
Key files: [3-5 most important paths]
Patterns: [Architecture patterns you follow]

WORKING:
Task: [What you're building]
Constraints: [Libraries, time, compatibility]
Done when: [Acceptance criteria]
```

## 2. The Product Manager Template

```
PERMANENT:

Current focus: [This quarter's OKR or goal]

WORKING:
Task: [PRD / analysis / update / brainstorm]
Input: [Data or docs to reference]
Output format: [Bullets, table, narrative, etc.]
```

## 3. The Technical Writer Template

```

STABLE:
Product: [What you're documenting]
Terminology: [Key terms and their correct usage]
Existing docs: [Where current docs live]

WORKING:
Task: [New page, update, API reference]

Length: [Target word count or section count]
```

## 4. The Researcher Template

```
PERMANENT:
Role: [Domain] researcher
Rigor: [Academic/applied/exploratory]
Bias awareness: Explicitly flag assumptions and limitations
Citation style: [Format preference]

STABLE:
Research area: [Topic and subtopic]
Key sources: [Foundational papers or datasets]

```

## 5. The UX Designer Template

```
PERMANENT:

STABLE:

Requirements: [Functionality and behavior]
Deliverable: [Wireframe, prototype, spec]
```

## How to use these

1. Pick the template closest to your role
2. Fill in the brackets with your specifics
3. Save the permanent and stable blocks — you'll reuse them
4. Only rewrite the working block each session

Or skip the manual work: import these directly into [ContextForge](https://convexforgets.com) and drag-and-drop them into zones.
