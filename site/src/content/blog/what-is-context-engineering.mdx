Every time you open ChatGPT, Claude, or any other LLM and paste a wall of text — you're doing context engineering. You're just doing it badly.

**Context engineering** is the practice of deliberately structuring the information you provide to a language model so it can do its best work. Instead of dumping everything into a single prompt, you organize context into layers with different lifespans and purposes.

## Why does it matter?

LLMs don't remember. Every conversation starts from zero. The only thing that shapes their behavior is what you put in the context window — and that window has limits.

Most people waste those limits:
- Repeating the same system instructions every session
- Mixing permanent rules with temporary tasks
- Losing track of which context blocks are still relevant
- Copy-pasting from documents without trimming irrelevant sections

The result? Inconsistent answers, wasted tokens, and the frustrating feeling that the AI "forgot" what you told it.

## The three-zone model

ContextForge uses a simple mental model: **Permanent**, **Stable**, and **Working** zones.

- **Permanent** — Things that never change: your role definition, coding style, communication preferences. Set once, reuse forever.
- **Stable** — Project-level context: tech stack, architecture decisions, reference docs. Changes when you switch projects.
- **Working** — The current task: what you're building right now, relevant code snippets, immediate constraints. Changes every session.

This isn't just organization for organization's sake. When you separate context by lifespan, you can:
1. Reuse permanent and stable blocks across sessions without re-typing
2. Swap working context without losing your foundation
3. Stay within token budgets by compressing or dropping the right layers

## Getting started

You don't need a tool to start context engineering (though [ContextForge](https://convexforgets.com) makes it much easier). Start by answering three questions before your next LLM session:

1. **What never changes?** Write it down once. That's your permanent zone.
2. **What's true for this project?** Tech stack, style guides, domain knowledge. That's stable.
3. **What am I doing right now?** The specific task and its constraints. That's working.

Even this simple separation will noticeably improve your results.
