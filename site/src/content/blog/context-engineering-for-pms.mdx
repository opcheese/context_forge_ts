Product managers use AI differently than developers. You're not writing code — you're drafting PRDs, analyzing user feedback, writing stakeholder updates, and brainstorming features. But the same principle applies: **structured context produces better output.**

## The PM permanent zone

Your permanent context should capture your communication style and role:

```
Role: Product manager at an early-stage B2B SaaS company
Audience: Technical founders, senior engineers, design leads
Style: Concise, data-informed, bias toward action
Format preferences: Bullet points over paragraphs. Tables for comparisons.
Frameworks: RICE for prioritization, Jobs-to-be-Done for user research
```

## Project-level stable context

This changes per product or initiative:

```
Product: ContextForge — context management tool for LLM power users
Stage: Pre-revenue, ~200 beta users
Key metrics: DAU, sessions per user, context blocks created
Current OKR: Increase weekly active sessions from 3.2 to 5.0
Competitors: PromptLayer, LangSmith (different focus but adjacent)
```

## Working context examples

**Writing a PRD:**
```
Task: Write a PRD for "Linked Blocks" feature
Input: Design doc at docs/plans/linked-blocks-shaping.md
Audience: Engineering team (3 devs)
Include: Problem statement, user stories, success metrics, out of scope
```

**Analyzing feedback:**
```
Task: Synthesize themes from 15 user interview transcripts
Focus: What blocks adoption? What drives retention?
Output: Top 5 themes with supporting quotes, recommended actions
```

**Stakeholder update:**
```
Task: Write weekly stakeholder update
Audience: CEO + CTO
Tone: Direct, highlight blockers and decisions needed
Cover: Linked blocks progress, beta user growth, next week priorities
```

## Why this works for PMs

Without context structure, you get generic MBA-speak from AI. The kind of output that sounds impressive but says nothing. With structured zones, you get output that sounds like *you* wrote it, because the AI knows your voice, your product, and your current focus.

The permanent zone prevents style drift. The stable zone keeps the AI grounded in your product reality. The working zone focuses each session on exactly what you need.
