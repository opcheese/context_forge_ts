# User Personas

Create 2-3 proto-personas. These are hypotheses about your users — mark everything as assumption until validated.

---

## Persona: [Name]

**Role / Context:** [What they do, their environment, experience level]

**Goals:**
1. [What they're trying to achieve — behavioral, not demographic]
2. [Second goal]
3. [Third goal if relevant]

**Frustrations:**
1. [Current pain point — what's broken or slow?]
2. [What workarounds do they use today?]
3. [What have they tried that failed?]

**Behaviors:**
- [How do they currently solve this problem?]
- [What tools/processes do they use?]
- [How often do they encounter this problem?]
- [What's their technical comfort level with relevant tools?]

**Representative Quote:**
> "[Something this persona would actually say about the problem — grounded in research if available, otherwise marked as assumption]"

**Validation Status:** [ ] HYPOTHESIZED / [ ] PARTIALLY VALIDATED / [ ] VALIDATED
**Evidence:** [Interview notes, survey data, support tickets, or "None yet — hypothesis only"]

[Repeat for each persona. 2-3 is typical. If you have more than 4, you probably haven't prioritized.]

## Persona Relationships
[How do these personas interact? Are any of them the same person in different contexts? Do their goals conflict?]
